When building Flutter Web applications that will be packaged as Chrome Extensions, there are specific configuration requirements due to Chrome's Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. This guide walks you through the necessary setup steps.

## Overview

Chrome Extensions enforce strict Content Security Policy (CSP) rules that prevent dynamically loaded scripts. Since the Sentry Flutter SDK typically loads the Sentry JavaScript SDK dynamically for web platforms, this approach won't work in Chrome Extension environments.

## Required Setup

### 1. Download the Sentry JavaScript Bundle

Instead of loading the Sentry JavaScript SDK dynamically, you need to include it as a static asset:

1. Download the minified Sentry JavaScript bundle. For example, for version 9.40.0:
   ```
   https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/9.40.0/bundle.tracing.min.js
   ```

2. Save this file to your Flutter web project's `web/` directory.

### 2. Include the Script in Your HTML

Add the Sentry JavaScript bundle to your `web/index.html` file:

```html {filename:web/index.html}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- Other head elements -->
  <script src="bundle.tracing.min.js" type="application/javascript"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your app content -->
</body>
</html>
```

### 3. Configure Your Flutter Build

When building your Flutter web app for Chrome Extensions, use the following build command to ensure compatibility:

```bash
flutter build web --no-web-resources-cdn --pwa-strategy=none --source-maps
```

**Build flags explained:**
- `--no-web-resources-cdn`: Prevents Flutter from loading resources from external CDNs, which may be blocked by CSP
- `--pwa-strategy=none`: Disables Progressive Web App features that may conflict with extension policies
- `--source-maps`: Generates source maps for better debugging and error reporting

### 4. Upload Source Maps

After building your application, upload the generated source maps to Sentry for better debugging:

```bash
sentry_dart_plugin
```

Make sure you have the [Sentry Dart Plugin](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/configuration/options/#sentry-dart-plugin) properly configured in your project.
