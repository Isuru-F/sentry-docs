## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session with [session replay](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/).

Send <PlatformLink to="/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/logs/">structured logs</PlatformLink> to Sentry and correlate them with errors and traces.

Select which Sentry features you'd like to configure to get the corresponding setup instructions below.

## Install

Run the command for your preferred path to add Sentry to your application.

### Use the Installation Wizard (Recommended)

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

The wizard then guides you through the setup process, asking you to enable additional (optional) Sentry features for your application beyond error monitoring.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-features-expandable" />

<Expandable title="What does the installation wizard change inside your application?">

- Creates config files with the default `Sentry.init()` calls for all runtimes (Node.js, Browser, and Edge)
- Adds a Next.js instrumentation hook to your project (`instrumentation.ts`)
- Creates or updates your Next.js config with the default Sentry settings
- Creates error handling components (`global-error.(jsx|tsx)` and `_error.jsx` for the Pages Router) if they don't already exist
- Creates `.sentryclirc` with an auth token to upload source maps (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- Adds an example page and route to your application to help verify your Sentry setup

</Expandable>

## Configure

If you want to expand on your Sentry configuration by adding additional functionality, or manually instrument your application, here are the configuration files the wizard would create. Initialize Sentry as early as possible.

### Client-Side Configuration

```javascript {tabTitle:Client} {filename:instrumentation-client.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,

  integrations: [
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay
    // Replay may only be enabled for the client-side
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ user-feedback
    Sentry.feedbackIntegration({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      colorScheme: "system",
    }),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ user-feedback
  ],
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs

  // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
  enableLogs: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs

  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay
  // Capture Replay for 10% of all
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
});
```

### Server-Side Configuration

```javascript {tabTitle:Server} {filename:sentry.server.config.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs

  // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
  enableLogs: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs

  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
});
```

For detailed manual setup instructions, see our [manual setup guide](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/).

## Capture Next.js Errors

Make sure runtime errors are surfaced to Sentry using Next.js error components.

### App Router

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-capture-errors/app-router-global-error" />

#### Errors from Nested React Server Components

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-capture-errors/nested-server-components" />

### Pages Router

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-capture-errors/pages-router-error" />

<Alert level="info">
  The installation wizard will scaffold these files for you if they are missing.

## Sending Logs

[Structured logging](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/logs/) lets users send text-based log information from their applications to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these logs can be viewed alongside relevant errors, searched by text-string, or searched using their individual attributes.

Use Sentry's logger to capture structured logs with meaningful attributes that help you debug issues and understand user behavior.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

const { logger } = Sentry;

logger.info("User completed checkout", {
  userId: 123,
  orderId: "order_456",
  amount: 99.99,
});

logger.error("Payment processing failed", {
  errorCode: "CARD_DECLINED",
  userId: 123,
  attemptCount: 3,
});

logger.warn(logger.fmt`Rate limit exceeded for user: ${123}`);
```

</OnboardingOption>

<OnboardingOption optionId="session-replay">

## Customizing Replays

[Replays](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/) allow you to see video-like reproductions of user sessions. 

By default, Session Replay masks sensitive data for privacy and to protect PII data. You can modify the replay configurations in your client-side Sentry initialization to show (unmask) specific content that's safe to display.

```javascript {filename:instrumentation-client.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.replayIntegration({
      // This will show the content of the div with the class "reveal-content" and the span with the data-safe-to-show attribute
      unmask: [".reveal-content", "[data-safe-to-show]"],
      // This will show all text content in replays. Use with caution.
      maskAllText: false,
      // This will show all media content in replays. Use with caution.
      blockAllMedia: false,
    }),
  ],
  // Only capture replays for 10% of sessions
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  // Capture replays for 100% of sessions with an error
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

```jsx
<div className="reveal-content">This content will be visible in replays</div>
<span data-safe-to-show>Safe user data</span>
```

</OnboardingOption>

## Custom Traces with Attributes

[Tracing](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/tracing/) allows you to monitor interactions between multiple services or applications. Create custom spans to measure specific operations and add meaningful attributes. This helps you understand performance bottlenecks and debug issues with detailed context.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

async function processUserData(userId) {
  return await Sentry.startSpan(
    {
      name: "Process User Data",
      op: "function",
      attributes: {
        userId: userId,
        operation: "data_processing",
        version: "2.1",
      },
    },
    async () => {
      const userData = await fetch(`/api/user?id=${userId}`).then((r) => r.json());

      return await Sentry.startSpan(
        {
          name: "Transform Data",
          op: "transform",
          attributes: { recordCount: userData.length, transformType: "normalize" },
        },
        () => transformUserData(userData)
      );
    }
  );
}

const span = Sentry.getActiveSpan();
if (span) {
  span.setAttributes({ cacheHit: true, region: "us-west-2", performanceScore: 0.95 });
}
```

</OnboardingOption>

## Verify Your Setup

If you haven't tested your Sentry configuration yet, let's do it now. You can confirm that Sentry is working properly and sending data to your Sentry project by using the example page and route created by the installation wizard:

1. Open the example page `/sentry-example-page` in your browser. For most Next.js applications, this will be at localhost.
2. Click the "Throw error" button. This triggers two errors:

- a frontend error
- an error within the API route

Sentry captures both of these errors for you. Additionally, the button click starts a performance trace to measure the time it takes for the API request to complete.

<Alert level="success" title="Tip">

Don't forget to explore the example files' code in your project to understand what's happening after your button click.

</Alert>

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify-locate-data" />

<Include name="nextjs-turbopack-warning-expandable.mdx" />

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your Next.js application and should already be sending error and performance data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics.
Our next recommended steps for you are:

- Learn about [instrumenting Next.js server actions](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/apis/#server-actions)
- Learn how to [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/usage/)
