With [tracing](/product/insights/overview/), Sentry tracks your software performance across your application services, measuring metrics like throughput and latency, and displaying the impact of errors across multiple systems.

Follow this guide to instrument tracing in your application, from basic setup to advanced custom metrics.

<PlatformCategorySection supported={["server", "serverless"]}>
  <Alert>
    If you're adopting Tracing in a high-throughput environment, we recommend testing prior to deployment to ensure that your service's performance characteristics maintain expectations.

## Step 1: Enable Tracing

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/tracing-step1-enable" />

## Step 2: Configure Distributed Tracing

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/tracing-step2-distributed" />

Learn more about [Distributed Tracing](./distributed-tracing/) and [Configure Sampling](./configure-sampling/).

## Step 3: Add Attributes to Spans

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/tracing-step3-attributes" />

## Step 4: Create Custom Spans

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/tracing-step4-custom-spans" />

Learn more about [Custom Instrumentation](./instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/).

## Step 5: Send Span Metrics

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/tracing-step5-metrics" />

## Verify Your Setup

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript"]} notSupported={["javascript.cordova"]}>

Verify that tracing is working correctly by using our <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/">automatic instrumentation</PlatformLink> or by starting and finishing a transaction using <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.

</PlatformSection>

While you're testing, set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `1.0`, as that ensures that every transaction will be sent to Sentry. Once testing is complete, you may want to set a lower <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> value, or switch to using <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> to selectively sample and filter your transactions, based on contextual data.

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have a comprehensive tracing setup that captures performance data across your entire application stack.

**OpenTelemetry Integration**: Sentry can integrate with OpenTelemetry. You can find more information <PlatformLink to="/opentelemetry/">here</PlatformLink>.

**Disabling Tracing**: If you want to disable tracing completely, neither `tracesSampleRate` nor `tracesSampler` should be defined in your SDK config. Setting `tracesSampleRate` to `0` will not disable tracing.

  **Production Optimization**: You can set `__SENTRY_TRACING__` to `false` to ensure tracing code is removed from your production build. See <PlatformLink to="/configuration/tree-shaking/">Tree Shaking</PlatformLink> for more information.
