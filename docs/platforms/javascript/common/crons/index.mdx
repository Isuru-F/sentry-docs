Monitor the uptime and performance of your scheduled jobs in Node.js. Get alerts when jobs fail, timeout, or don't run as expected.

{/* ![Cron Monitoring Setup](placeholder-cron-setup.gif) */}

## UI Setup (Recommended)

The most complete way to monitor your crons is by creating monitors in Sentry's web interface:

1. Create monitor in Sentry UI with your cron schedule
2. Add notification code to your job
3. Get alerts when jobs fail or don't run

This approach gives you complete monitoring setup including alerts configuration.

## Setup Methods

Choose the method that matches your current setup:

* [UI Setup](ui-setup) - Create monitors in Sentry's web interface
* [Automatic Integration](automatic) - Auto-instrument existing cron libraries  
* [Manual Integration](manual) - Full SDK integration with custom handling
* [Advanced Setup](advanced) - Programmatically create and manage monitors

### Automatic Integration

* [node-cron](automatic#node-cron)
* [cron](automatic#cron-library) 
* [node-schedule](automatic#node-schedule)

If you're using one of these popular cron libraries, use the automatic integration for seamless monitoring.

### Manual Integration

* [withMonitor() wrapper](manual#withmonitor)
* [captureCheckIn() calls](manual#capturecheckin)
* [Custom error handling](manual#error-handling)

## Other Tools

If you have custom cron logic or use a different scheduling library, we recommend the [manual integration approach](manual) which gives you full control over when and how check-ins are sent.

For advanced use cases like CI/CD pipelines or managing many monitors, consider the [programmatic setup](advanced) which lets you create monitors via code.
