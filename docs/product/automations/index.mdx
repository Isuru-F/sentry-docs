Sentry's Automations can be configured to take external actions, like send notifications and create tickets when specific criteria are met. They can be paired with monitors to notify a team when an issue is created, or call a webhook or integration.

### Some examples of when you could use an automation
- Send a notification to your team's Slack channel when a new error occurs in an existing issue
- Create a ticket in JIRA when an issue is created and a team member is assigned
- Call a webhook or integration when an issue is created

## Creating an Automation

To create an automation, navigate to the [Automations](https://sentry.io/issues/automations/new/) page and click **Create Automation**.

### Triggers

A trigger is an action that must occur for the automation to run. For example, you may want to send a notification to your team's Slack channel _when an issue is created_. You can select multiple triggers in a single automation. They will run under an `ANY` condition, meaning that if any one of the triggers happen, the automation will run. 

### Filters 

Filters are conditions that must be met for the automation to run. For example, you may want to create a ticket _only for issues that are assigned to a specific team_ and _at a certain severity_. You can create multiple filters in a single automation, and group them under either `ANY` or `ALL` conditions. For `ANY` conditions, if any one of the filters are true, the automation will run. For `ALL` conditions, only if all of the filters are true, the automation will run.

### Actions

Actions are the events that will be executed when the automation is run. You can send notifications on any channel you're integrated with, create tickets, for example, in JIRA, or call a webhook or integration. You can create multiple actions in a single automation. 

## Connecting Automations to Monitors

You can connect automations to monitors to automatically run when a monitor is triggered. To do so, navigate to the [Monitors](https://sentry.io/issues/monitors/) page and click on the monitor you want to connect the automation to. Then, click the **Automations** tab and click **Connect Automation**. You can select the automation you want to connect to the monitor.

## Managing Automations

You can see a list of all your automations in the [Automations](https://sentry.io/issues/automations/) page. 

By clicking on a automation, you can view the details, edit the automation, or turn it on or off.

The details page will show a high level chart of how often the automation has run, a list of the most recent runs, the configuration, and connected monitors.
