Sentry's Monitors can be configured using conditional rules to create issues when specific criteria are met. For example, you could monitor when the duration of a transaction takes longer than 3 seconds on a particular browser. Further automate the issue creation experience using Monitors to automatically add assignees and set different priorities based on severity. 

## Types of Monitors

There are three types of Monitors:

- [Metric Monitors](placeholder): Track for errors based on span attributes and custom metrics.
- [Cron Monitors](/product/monitors/crons/): Track the uptime and performance of any scheduled, recurring job.
- [Uptime Monitors](placeholder): Track the uptime and performance of any HTTP request.
    
## Creating a Monitor

To create a monitor, navigate to the [Monitors](https://sentry.io/issues/monitors/new/) page and click **Create Monitor**. You can choose between the three types of monitors. Each one will have a separate configuration process.

### General Settings

Monitors are made of attributes that define when to create an issue, and actions that define what to do when an issue is created.

- Name the monitor
- Select the project, and in some cases, the environment
- Select attributes based on the monitor type
- Set priority based on attributes
- Set the assignee
- Set auto-resolve based on attributes
- Connect [custom automations](/product/automations/custom-automations/) to pair with the monitor, like notifications and ticket creation

### Metric Monitor Settings

Metric Monitors are used to track errors based on span attributes and custom metrics. 

[!metric-monitor-config](./img/metric-monitor-config.png)

Choose the metric, the interval for how often to check, and the way you want to monitor for changes. You can choose an absolute number threshold, a percentage change, or dynamic anomaly detection.

### Cron Monitor Settings

Cron Monitors are used to track the uptime and performance of any scheduled, recurring job. 

[!cron-monitor-config](./img/cron-monitor-config.png)

Choose the schedule for how often to check, set the check-in margin, the max runtime, and failure tollerance.

### Uptime Monitor Settings

Uptime Monitors are used to track the uptime and performance of any HTTP request.

[!uptime-monitor-config](./img/uptime-monitor-config.png)

Choose the URL and HTTP request you wish to monitor. Set the interval, timeout, and any headers you wish to include.

## Managing Monitors

You can see a list of all your monitors in the [Monitors](https://sentry.io/issues/monitors/) page. Select a monitor type at the top of the page to narrow down the list. 

By clicking on a monitor, you can view the details, edit the monitor, or disable it.

The details page will show a high level chart of the monitor's performance, the configuration, created issue, and connected automations.
