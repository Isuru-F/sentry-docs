<Alert level="warning">

Logging is not supported in the [loader or CDN script](/platforms/javascript/install/loader/) for browser JavaScript. We recommend installing the SDK via [NPM](/platforms/javascript/install/npm/) to use logging. We are tracking support for the loader and CDN script in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/16314).
