Tracing is already enabled if you followed the getting started guide. Verify it's working by checking your configuration files:

```javascript {tabTitle:Client} {filename:instrumentation-client.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // This enables tracing - start with 100% in development
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ... rest of your config
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle:Server} {filename:sentry.server.config.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // This enables tracing - start with 100% in development  
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ... rest of your config
});
```

**For production, reduce the sample rate:**

```javascript
// Sample 10% of transactions in production
tracesSampleRate: 0.1,
```
