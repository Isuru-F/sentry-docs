Connect traces across your React frontend and backend services:

```javascript {filename:instrument.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // Configure which requests should propagate traces
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "localhost",
    "your-api-domain.com",
    /^https:\/\/api\.your-domain\.com/,
  ],
  // ... rest of your config
});
```

Now API calls from your React app will be connected to your backend traces:

```javascript
// This fetch request will automatically include trace headers
const response = await fetch('https://api.your-domain.com/user/profile', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
});
```

If you're using React Router, make sure to [set up the integration](../features/react-router/) to trace navigation events!
