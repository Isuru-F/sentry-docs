Connect traces across your frontend, API routes, and external services by configuring trace propagation:

```javascript {tabTitle:Client} {filename:instrumentation-client.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // Configure which requests should propagate traces
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "localhost",
    "your-domain.com",
    /^https:\/\/api\.your-domain\.com/,
    /^\/api\//,  // Local API routes
  ],
  // ... rest of your config
});
```

Add trace data to your page metadata for better frontend-backend connection:

```typescript {filename:app/layout.tsx}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

export function generateMetadata() {
  return {
    title: "My App",
    // Connect frontend and backend traces
    other: {
      ...Sentry.getTraceData(),
    },
  };
}
```

Now requests between your frontend and backend will be connected in a single distributed trace!
